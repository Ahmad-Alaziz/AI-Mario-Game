# AI-Mario-Game
AI learns to play Mario using a genetic algorithm.

Note: This program was written during my first year of studies, thus code style might cause bleeding in the eye or other more serious effects... you have been warned (It is still quite fun nevertheless ;)

## AI Mode
  Inspired by the process of natural selection, 200 Mario entities are spawned with randomly generated "brains". The Mario which performs the best is selected as the "fittest" and asked to reproduce more Marios with a simmilar yet not identical Brain.... after a few generations, the mutations keep evolving the marios untill they play the perfect game ;)
